        During the application process, the eligibility worker collects the client's cell phone number and asks:

      <p><b>Would you like to receive text message notifications for your CalFresh quarterly report at this phone number?</b></p>

        The defendant texts her case number to the system. The system
        should be forgiving, accepting input such as <code>13F0102292</code>
        or <code>13 F 102292</code>, and not requiring <code>-001</code>
        for co-defendant code.
